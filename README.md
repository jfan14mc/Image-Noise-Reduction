# ImageNoiseReduction
Random noise can be reduced out by taking many images of the same subject and averaging them out, while structural noise can be reduced if a pattern of static is subtracted from the image. By averaging out a group of images and subtracting an average of raw static away from it, this program reduces the both random and structural noise in a image.
